# Omnifood

Omnifood is a responsive single-page website that was created as part of the course [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) to implement and consolidate the learned concepts about HTML, CSS and design with an end-to-end real-world website project.

## Note

The content used in this project was copied from the [course starter files](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/html-css-course/tree/master/starter/07-Omnifood-Desktop/content) but the HTML and CSS was coded manually.
